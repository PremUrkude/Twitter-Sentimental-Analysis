# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
In this project, we will explore various NLP and ML algorithms, preprocess text data, extract relevant features, and train models to classify tweet sentiments. By employing state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies, we aspire to build a reliable tool that contributes to a deeper understanding of the sentiments expressed on Twitter.
